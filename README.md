# The Show Hub

## What is this?

The Show Hub is a simple Android app developed for a technical interview challenge.

### Challenge Description

- Create a simple Android app with an initial screen showing a button which when pressed initiates presenting a new screen which requests a list of tv shows and presents them to the user.
- Produce clean and well formatted/documented code following appropriate coding standards depending on the platform you choose
- Send a request to the movie api database and parse the list of tv shows
- For each of the tv shows returned by the API a set of data will be returned, use the following two fields to populate the list: name : the name of the tv show. poster_path : An image url for the given tv show. (Note the api only returns a path of the image url e.g “/nMhv6jG5dtLdW7rgguYWvpbk0YN.jpg”, in order to create a full url to request the image you must set the base url as the following “https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/” so the URL for the image would be “https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/nMhv6jG5dtLdW7rgguYWvpbk0YN.jpg”
- You should use a RecyclerView for displaying the list of tv shows
- Add a button to the screen that will allow the user to sort pressed. The user should have a few different options when it comes to sorting, e.g alphabetically, chronologically etc.
- Bonus points will be given to any extra features implemented
